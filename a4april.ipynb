    "The decision tree classifier algorithm is a machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It builds a model in the form of a tree structure, where each internal node represents a feature or attribute, each branch represents a decision rule based on that feature, and each leaf node represents a class label. The algorithm learns these decision rules from the training data and uses them to make predictions on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of building a decision tree starts with the root node, which represents the entire dataset. At each step, the algorithm selects the best feature that divides the data into the most homogeneous subsets based on some criterion, such as Gini impurity or information gain. This feature becomes the decision rule at the current node, and the data is split into subsets based on the possible values of that feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process continues recursively for each subset, creating child nodes and further splitting the data until a stopping criterion is met. This criterion could be a maximum depth limit, a minimum number of samples at a node, or other measures to prevent overfitting. Finally, the leaf nodes are assigned class labels based on the majority class of the samples at that node.\n",

    " The mathematical intuition behind decision tree classification involves evaluating the quality of different feature splits in order to determine the most informative features for decision-making. This is commonly done using criteria like Gini impurity or information gain.\n",

    "Gini impurity measures the degree of impurity or disorder within a node. It ranges from 0 (pure node, all samples belong to the same class) to 1 (impure node, samples are evenly distributed among different classes). The Gini impurity for a node with respect to a particular class can be calculated as follows:\n",
